# üß† LoRA Explained: End-to-End with Matrices and Backpropagation

**LoRA** (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique for fine-tuning large language models **efficiently**, by **freezing the full weight matrices** and **injecting trainable low-rank matrices** instead.

We‚Äôll walk through:

* The idea behind LoRA
* A real matrix example
* What changes in the forward pass
* How backpropagation works
* What actually gets updated

---

## üß© Motivation: Why LoRA?

Let‚Äôs say you have a large attention matrix $W_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times k}$. Updating all of it during fine-tuning can be:

* **Expensive** (GPU, memory, time)
* **Unnecessary** (the pre-trained model already knows a lot)

LoRA says:

> *‚ÄúFreeze the big matrix. Add a small, trainable delta instead.‚Äù*

## üîß LoRA in Attention Projection

Normally, attention computes:

$$
Q = X \cdot W_Q
$$

With LoRA, this becomes:

$$
Q = X \cdot (W_Q + A_Q B_Q)
$$

Where:

* $A_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$
* $B_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$
* $r \ll d$ ‚Äî often 1‚Äì8

Only $A_Q$ and $B_Q$ are trained.
$W_Q$ stays frozen.

## üî¢ Setup

Assume:

* 3 tokens, each a 5D vector ‚Üí $X \in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 5}$
* Original query projection: $W_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 3}$

### Input $X$:

$$
X = \begin{bmatrix}
0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.2 & 0.0 \\\\
0.6 & 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\\\
0.4 & 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.5 & 0.1 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

---

## üîí Original Query Matrix $W_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 3}$

$$
W_Q = \begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.1 & 0.0 \\\\
0.0 & 0.3 & 0.2 \\\\
0.1 & 0.0 & 0.4 \\\\
0.3 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\\\
0.0 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \text{(Frozen)}
$$

---

## ü™õ LoRA Parameters

### Low-rank matrices:

$$
A_Q = \begin{bmatrix}
0.1 & 0.0 \\\\
0.2 & 0.1 \\\\
0.1 & 0.0 \\\\
0.0 & 0.2 \\\\
0.1 & 0.1 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 2}
$$

$$
B_Q = \begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\\\
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.2 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\quad \in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 3}
$$

---

## üßÆ Step 1: Forward Pass with LoRA

1. Compute delta:

$$
\Delta W_Q = A_Q \cdot B_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 3}
$$

2. Inject into projection:

$$
W_Q^{\text{LoRA}} = W_Q + \Delta W_Q
$$

3. Final query output:

$$
Q = X \cdot W_Q^{\text{LoRA}}
$$

Let‚Äôs say this gives:

$$
Q =
\begin{bmatrix}
0.161 & 0.190 & 0.306 \\\\
0.232 & 0.449 & 0.369 \\\\
0.333 & 0.291 & 0.401 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

This is the output of the query projection with LoRA injected.

## üîÅ Step 2: Backpropagation ‚Äî What Gets Updated?

Assume you compute a loss $L$ further downstream (e.g., cross-entropy from logits).

Then during backpropagation:

### üî∏ You compute:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial Q}
\quad \text{(shape: } 3 \times 3 \text{)}
$$

### üî∏ You propagate it to the LoRA parameters:

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial B_Q} = (X \cdot A_Q)^T \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial Q}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial L}{\partial A_Q} = X^T \cdot \left( \frac{\partial L}{\partial Q} \cdot B_Q^T \right)
$$

These gradients are used to update **only** $A_Q$ and $B_Q$.

### ‚úÖ You do **not** update $W_Q$

It‚Äôs frozen ‚Äî no memory usage or gradient computation needed for it.
