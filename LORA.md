You‚Äôre very welcome! I‚Äôm glad the matrix-style format is working well for you. Let‚Äôs now extend your blog post with a clear, **matrix-style explanation of how PEFT ‚Äî especially LoRA ‚Äî integrates into attention layers**, using your example structure.

This section is fully compatible for copy-paste into your GitHub `.md` file.

## üß© How Does PEFT (LoRA) Fit Into Attention?

Let‚Äôs say you're working with a large language model (LLM) like GPT, BERT, or T5, and you want to **fine-tune it efficiently**.

Instead of updating **all parameters** in the model, **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)** allows you to **freeze the original weights** (like $W_Q$) and only train small **low-rank matrices**.

---

## üîß What is LoRA Doing?

Let‚Äôs zoom into the **query projection** layer of attention, which uses:

$$
Q = X \cdot W_Q
$$

With LoRA, we **freeze $W_Q$** and inject trainable matrices $A$ and $B$:

$$
Q = X \cdot (W_Q + A_Q B_Q)
$$

Where:

* $A_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times r}$
* $B_Q \in \mathbb{R}^{r \times k}$
* $r \ll d$ (e.g., 4 or 8)

This means **you only train $A_Q$ and $B_Q$**, not the original full matrix.

---

## üí° Why Does This Work?

Because **most of the model‚Äôs knowledge is already in the pre-trained weights**. We don‚Äôt need to re-learn everything ‚Äî we just need **small tweaks** to adapt it to a new task.

This reduces memory and compute massively:

* Instead of training a full 5√ó3 matrix (15 params),
* You train two: $A_Q$ (5√ó2) and $B_Q$ (2√ó3) = only 16 params

## üßÆ Matrix View with Numbers

Let‚Äôs say you have:

$$
X =
\begin{bmatrix}
0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.2 & 0.0 \\\\
0.6 & 0.7 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.3 \\\\
0.4 & 0.2 & 0.6 & 0.5 & 0.1 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\in \mathbb{R}^{3 \times 5}
$$

$$
W_Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.1 & 0.0 \\\\
0.0 & 0.3 & 0.2 \\\\
0.1 & 0.0 & 0.4 \\\\
0.3 & 0.2 & 0.1 \\\\
0.0 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 3}
\quad \text{(frozen)}
$$

Now add LoRA:

$$
A_Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.1 & 0.0 \\\\
0.2 & 0.1 \\\\
0.1 & 0.0 \\\\
0.0 & 0.2 \\\\
0.1 & 0.1 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\in \mathbb{R}^{5 \times 2}
,\quad
B_Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
0.2 & 0.3 & 0.1 \\\\
0.1 & 0.2 & 0.2 \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\in \mathbb{R}^{2 \times 3}
$$

### Final Q projection becomes:

$$
Q = X \cdot (W_Q + A_Q B_Q)
$$

And **only $A_Q$ and $B_Q$** get updated during backpropagation!

## üîÑ Training Flow with LoRA

1. **Forward pass**:

   * Compute $Q = X(W_Q + A_Q B_Q)$
2. **Backpropagation**:

   * Freeze gradients for $W_Q$
   * Compute gradients only for $A_Q$, $B_Q$
3. **Update step**:

   * Apply optimizer (e.g. AdamW) to $A_Q$, $B_Q$
