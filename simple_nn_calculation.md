# 🧠 Understanding Backpropagation: Step-by-Step Gradient Derivation in a Tiny Neural Network

Let’s walk through a **concrete and simple example** of how gradients are calculated during **backpropagation** in a neural network. We’ll start with a tiny network, go layer by layer, and show **exactly how we get gradients like `0.069`**.

---

## 🔧 Setup: A Minimal Neural Network

We use a 2-layer network with:

* A **single input**: `x = 1.0`
* One **hidden neuron** with weight `w1 = 0.5`
* One **output neuron** with weight `w2 = 0.5`
* The **true label**: `y_true = 0.0` (binary classification)

---

## 🔁 Forward Pass

### 🧩 Hidden Layer:

$$
z_1 = x \cdot w_1 = 1.0 \cdot 0.5 = 0.5 \\
a_1 = \text{ReLU}(z_1) = 0.5
$$

### 🧮 Output Layer:

$$
z_2 = a_1 \cdot w_2 = 0.5 \cdot 0.5 = 0.25 \\
a_2 = \text{Sigmoid}(z_2) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-0.25}} \approx 0.562
$$

So the model predicts **0.562**, but the true label is **0**. Now we calculate the loss and backpropagate the error.

---

## 🔄 Backward Pass (Backpropagation)

### Step 1: Loss Gradient w\.r.t. Prediction (`a2`)

We use **Binary Cross Entropy Loss**:

$$
L = -\left[y \cdot \log(a_2) + (1 - y) \cdot \log(1 - a_2)\right]
$$

Since $y = 0$, the loss simplifies to:

$$
L = -\log(1 - a_2)
$$

So the gradient is:

$$
\frac{dL}{da_2} = a_2 - y = 0.562 - 0 = 0.562
$$

---

### Step 2: Gradient of Sigmoid (from `z2` to `a2`)

$$
\frac{da_2}{dz_2} = a_2 (1 - a_2) = 0.562 \cdot 0.438 \approx 0.246
$$

---

### Step 3: Chain Rule — Gradient of Loss w\.r.t `z2`

$$
\frac{dL}{dz_2} = \frac{dL}{da_2} \cdot \frac{da_2}{dz_2} = 0.562 \cdot 0.246 \approx 0.138
$$

This is the **error signal flowing back from the output layer.**

---

### Step 4: Gradient of `w2`

$$
\frac{dL}{dw_2} = \frac{dL}{dz_2} \cdot \frac{dz_2}{dw_2} = 0.138 \cdot a_1 = 0.138 \cdot 0.5 = 0.069
$$

✔️ That’s how we compute the **gradient for `w2`: 0.069**

---

### Step 5: Gradient for `w1` (Back to Hidden Layer)

We go one step further back.

First, compute the gradient w\.r.t. `a1`:

$$
\frac{dL}{da_1} = \frac{dL}{dz_2} \cdot w_2 = 0.138 \cdot 0.5 = 0.069
$$

Now apply the ReLU derivative:

Since $z_1 = 0.5 > 0$, we get:

$$
\frac{da_1}{dz_1} = 1
\Rightarrow \frac{dL}{dz_1} = \frac{dL}{da_1} \cdot 1 = 0.069
$$

Now:

$$
\frac{dL}{dw_1} = \frac{dL}{dz_1} \cdot x = 0.069 \cdot 1.0 = 0.069
$$

✔️ That’s how we compute the **gradient for `w1`: 0.069**

---

## ✅ Final Gradients

| Parameter | Gradient |
| --------- | -------- |
| `w2`      | 0.069    |
| `w1`      | 0.069    |

---

## 🧮 Weight Update (Using Gradient Descent)

With a learning rate of `0.1`, the optimizer updates:

$$
w_2 = w_2 - \eta \cdot \frac{dL}{dw_2} = 0.5 - 0.1 \cdot 0.069 = 0.4931
$$

$$
w_1 = w_1 - \eta \cdot \frac{dL}{dw_1} = 0.5 - 0.1 \cdot 0.069 = 0.4931
$$

## 🔁 Summary

This simple walkthrough shows exactly how backpropagation flows backward through a neural network, using:

* **Activation derivatives** (sigmoid, ReLU)
* **Chain rule**
* **Gradient descent**

You now understand how gradients are **calculated and used to update weights**, making the model learn step by step.
