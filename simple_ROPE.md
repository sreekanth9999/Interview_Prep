# ðŸ§­ Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) â€” Explained with Matrices and Rotation Intuition

Transformers need to know **where tokens appear** in a sentence â€” otherwise, `"The cat sleeps"` and `"Sleeps cat the"` would look identical.

**Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE)** give the model this sense of order â€” but instead of adding position vectors, RoPE **rotates** the attention vectors based on token position.

---

## ðŸ§  What Problem Does RoPE Solve?

Classic positional encodings (used in BERT, GPT-2):

| Method            | How it Works                          |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Learned Embedding | Add a trainable vector to input token |
| Sinusoidal        | Add a fixed sine/cosine pattern       |

âœ… These work, but are **added to the input**, and not directly used inside attention.

---

## ðŸ”„ What Does RoPE Do Instead?

RoPE rotates the **query and key vectors** **inside the attention mechanism**, using their **position index $p$**.

Before computing attention, RoPE transforms:

$$
q' = \text{RoPE}(q, p), \quad k' = \text{RoPE}(k, p)
$$

Then attention is computed as:

$$
\text{score} = q'_p \cdot k'_p
$$

## ðŸ§® How RoPE Works (2D Rotation)

Split your vector into **pairs** like this:

$$
[x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4] \Rightarrow [(x_1, x_2),\ (x_3, x_4)]
$$

For each pair, RoPE applies a 2D rotation:

$$
\text{Rotated}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\\\
x_2
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\cos \theta & -\sin \theta \\\\
\sin \theta & \cos \theta \\\\
\end{bmatrix}
\cdot
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\\\
x_2
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Where:

* $\theta$ depends on token **position $p$** and **dimension**

## ðŸ“˜ Example: Rotating a Vector with RoPE

Letâ€™s say our query vector is:

$$
q = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0] \quad \text{(4D vector â†’ 2 pairs)}
$$

Weâ€™ll apply RoPE at different positions:

---

### ðŸ”¸ At $p = 0$ (position 0)

Rotation angle $\theta = 0^\circ$

$$
\text{Rotated} = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0] \quad \text{(no change)}
$$

---

### ðŸ”¸ At $p = 1$

Letâ€™s use $\theta = 30^\circ$

* For first pair:

  $$
  (1, 0) \to (\cos 30^\circ, \sin 30^\circ) \approx (0.866, 0.5)
  $$
* For second pair:

  $$
  (0, 1) \to (-\sin 30^\circ, \cos 30^\circ) \approx (-0.5, 0.866)
  $$

Final rotated vector:

$$
q' = [0.866, 0.5, -0.5, 0.866]
$$

---

### ðŸ”¸ At $p = 2$

Letâ€™s use $\theta = 60^\circ$

* First pair:

  $$
  (1, 0) â†’ (\cos 60^\circ, \sin 60^\circ) â‰ˆ (0.5, 0.866)
  $$
* Second pair:

  $$
  (0, 1) â†’ (-0.866, 0.5)
  $$

Final:

$$
q' = [0.5, 0.866, -0.866, 0.5]
$$

## ðŸŽ¯ What Changes With Higher $p$?

| Position $p$ | Rotation Angle | Final Vector Shape       |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------ |
| 0            | 0Â°             | No change                |
| 1            | 30Â°            | Slight rotation          |
| 2            | 60Â°            | Further rotation         |
| â€¦            | Increasing     | Keeps rotating clockwise |

âœ… This gives each token a unique **rotated view of the space** â€” encoding **relative and absolute position**.

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits of RoPE

| Feature            | Why It Matters                            |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Efficient          | No new parameters â€” uses math only        |
| Generalizable      | Works with long sequences                 |
| Embeds position    | Into Q and K directly (used in attention) |
| No separate vector | Doesnâ€™t grow memory size                  |

## âœ… Final Summary

| Concept         | Description                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| $p$             | Position of token in the sequence           |
| Rotation Matrix | Applied to each pair in Q and K             |
| Result          | Q and K are position-aware before attention |
| Used In         | LLaMA, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, etc.                |
| Advantage       | Injects position into the core of attention |
